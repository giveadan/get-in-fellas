        <p>Join Dr. Steven Solomon, board certified Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist and a self proclaimed "frat boy turned shrink", as he looks to round up his fellow bros for a trip into the often-untouched-by-men space of ‚Äúbromotions‚Äù. 
            Using a combination of pop based culture segments, empathy building guests and expert interviews, Dr. Solomon will pass down everything he wished he'd known in his 20‚Äôs to the next generation of young gentlemen. 
            Add "Get in Fellas, We're Going to Therapy" and help kick start your journey to becoming a kinder, more gentle Bro. (And you'll finally be able to say "kinda" when girls on Hinge ask you if you're in therapy üòâ)</p>
